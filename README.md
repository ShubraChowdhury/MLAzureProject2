# Operationalizing Machine Learning
## Overview
In this project, you will continue to work with the Bank Marketing dataset. We will use Azure to configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it, and consume it. W will also create, publish, and consume a pipeline. 

## Project main steps
In this project, you will following the below steps:

- Authentication
I have usedthe lab Udacity provided and thus I have skipped this step since I am  not authorized to create a security principal. 

- Automated ML Experiment
 In this step, I have created an experiment using Automated ML, configure a compute cluster, and use that cluster to run the experiment.
